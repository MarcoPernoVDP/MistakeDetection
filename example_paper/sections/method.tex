\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

This section describes your approach in detail. Use subsections to organize different components.

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Formally define the problem you are solving. Include mathematical notation as needed:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \ell(y_i, \hat{y}_i)
\end{equation}

where $y_i$ is the ground truth and $\hat{y}_i$ is the prediction.

\subsection{Proposed Approach}

Describe your method's architecture and key components. Use figures to illustrate:

\begin{figure}[t]

    \fbox{\parbox{0.9\linewidth}{\centering [Your architecture diagram here]}}
    \caption{Overview of the proposed method.}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Implementation Details}

Provide implementation details such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network architecture specifics
    \item Training procedures
    \item Hyperparameters
    \item Data preprocessing
\end{itemize}
